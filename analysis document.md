1) Introduction : The Tool we are asked to build has to make some modifications in the file so that it aligns with some specific rules.Its essentially will be an auto-correcter/text-formatter.The input will be 2 arguments of the file name in which the first argument will be the input and will remain,while the second argument will be the output which will be the first file modified.In that first file modifications will be made according to a set of rules that our tool will operate with.Below are the rules that our tool must follow to give us the desired outcome: 
   1. The hex function shall apply the hex rule which is to replace the previous word(hex string) with decimal (Ex. "1E(hex) files were added" -> "30 files were added ")
   2. The bin function shall apply the bin rule which is to replace the previous word(bin string) with decimal (Ex. "It has been 10(bin) years" -> " It has been 2 years")
   3. The up function shall convert the previous word to its uppercase version (if accompanied by a number the previous specified number of words will be uppercased instead) (Ex: "Ready, set, go (up) !" -> "Ready, set, GO!") (Ex: "This is so exciting (up, 2)" -> "This is SO EXCITING")
   4. The low function shall convert the previous word to its lowercase version (if accompanied by a number the previous specified number of words will be lowercased instead) (Ex: "I should stop SHOUTING (low)" -> "I should stop shouting") (Ex: "I SHOULD STOP SHOUTING (low, 3) " -> "I should stop shouting")
   5. The cap function shall convert the previous word to its capitalised version (if accompanied by a number the previous specified number of words will be capitalised instead) (Ex: "Welcome to the Brooklyn bridge (cap)" -> "Welcome to the Brooklyn Bridge") (Ex: "welcome to the brooklyn bridge (cap, 5)" -> "Welcome To The Brooklyn Bridge")
   6. For each single punctuation sign ., ,, !, ?, : and ; it should be close to the previous word and have space to the next word of it (Ex: "I was sitting over there ,and then BAMM !!" -> "I was sitting over there, and then BAMM!!")
       <Exception> for groups of punctuation like: ... or !? the sign should have no space to its previous word and a space to its next word (Ex. "I was thinking ... You were right" -> "I was thinking... You were right")
   7. The punctuation sign ' must always be found with another instance of it and it should be placed to the left and right of the word in the middle of them without any spaces.(Ex: "I am exactly how they describe me: ' awesome '" -> "I am exactly how they describe me: 'awesome'") If there are more than one word between the ' ' marks (Ex: "As Elton John said: ' I am the most well-known homosexual in the world '" -> "As Elton John said: 'I am the most well-known homosexual in the world'")
   8. Every instance of a should be turned into an if the following word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or an h (Ex: "There it was. A amazing rock!" -> "There it was. An amazing rock!")
